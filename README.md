#_Web Programming Course Project_
***
* This is a simple `PHP` project that I created to learn how to use `PHP` and `SQL` better.
* First thing you need to run this project is to have installed `docker` and `docker-compose`.
* Make sure that your **80** port is open and not used by other applications.
* After that you can run the project by typing `docker-compose up -d` in the terminal.
* Enjoy it.
